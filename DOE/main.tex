		The work will be mainly conducted at North Carolina State University. 


		The PI joined 
		the nuclear theory group at North Carolina State University, which consist
		of Chueng-Ryong Ji, Thomas Sch\"afer, and Mithat \"Unsal. 
		North Carolina State also has a strong representation in	
		nuclear astrophysics, led by Carla Fr\"ohlich, Gail McLaughlin,
		and Jim Kneller. 
		The groups collaborate with the Nuclear Theory Groups 
		at Duke  and the University of North
		Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
		Nuclear theory faculty at Duke include Steffen Bass, 
		Shailesh Chandrasekharan, Tom Mehen, and Roxanne Springer. 
		The theory group at UNC Chapel Hill consists of Jon Engel, Joaquin Drut and Amy Nicholson.
		
		The  NCSU nuclear theory group has access to computing capabilities of  
		North Carolina State University, which   
		maintains \href{https://projects.ncsu.edu/hpc//main.php}{High Performance Computing} 
		cluster. The cluster has 1344 computes nodes (mostly dual Xeon), 
		over 11000 cores, 2-4GB per core distributed memory, and 10Gb Ethernet interconnects.
		GPU (NVIDIA) nodes are available. 
		The cluster provides 1TB mass storage space per project. 
		The PI applied and got access to the cluster under the project titled  
		``Gluon saturation''. 
		Currently the PI has a common access 
		to the cluster; however, a dedicated high-priority computing queue can be set up 
		if required. 
		
		For faculties, North Carolina State University provides free access to 
		many commercial software products including Wolfram Mathematica, Matlab, and
		Waterloo Maple.  The PI will also utilize \href{https://github.ncsu.edu}{GitHub}, 
		web-based hosting service 
		for software development projects that use the Git revision control system, 
		provided by North Carolina State University.  


		The PI is also a Riken-BNL fellow and will in-part work  at 
		Riken-BNL research center (RBRC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL).
		{\bf During the initial five-year appointment with RBRC 
		(2018-2023), the PIs teaching load is reduced to one course per year. }   
		The nuclear theory group at BNL consists of 
		Yoshitaka Hatta,
		Frithjof Karsch,
		Dmitri Kharzeev,
		Yacine Mehtar-Tani,
		Swagato Mukherjee,
		Peter Petreczky,
		Rob Pisarski,
		Bj\"orn Schenke,
		and Raju Venugopalan. 
		The nuclear theory group has strong ties with the nuclear theory group 
		at Stony Brook University and specifically to 
		Edward Shuryak, Jacobus Verbaarschot, Ismail Zahed,  Derek Teaney,
		Dmitri Kharzeev, and  Sergey Syritsyn. 
		BNL is also a home for Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, the world renowned 
		accelerator facility.    


		Computational Science Initiative (CSI) group at BNL 
		provides support in optimizing and writing high performance 
		simulation software. The PI have successfully collaborated with 
		CSI in the past and is going to continue in the future. In particular, 
		the CSI offered support to the PI in rewriting time critical 
		parts of simulations for GPU; the PI exploratory 
		work has demonstrated that for the JIMWLK evolution this leads 
		to 300 fold decrease in computational time. 

		Additionally nuclear physics  groups at BNL and SBU launched 
		the Center for Frontiers in Nuclear Science (CFNS), which mission
		is to promote and facilitate the realization of the U.S. based 
		EIC by enhancing the science case and collaborations among the 
		scientists around the world interested in the EIC. The PI is in contact
		with several CFNS working groups.

\section{Budget justification}
        \label{sec:budget}
		\vspace{1.2em}			

		\subsection*{Personnel} 
		\vspace{0.5em}			

		\noindent
		Two months of {\bf summer salary} is requested for the Principal Investigator in each year of the project and
		is calculated on the current rate with an anticipated (1-3)\% annual increase throughout the project.  
		The salary for the PI is based on the current 9-month salary. 
		The PI will be responsible for the overall coordination of the project and the supervision of the graduate 
		students and other project personnel. 
	\vspace{0.5em}		

	\noindent
	{\bf Graduate student} support is based on the current University rate for graduate students with an anticipated 
		annual increase of 1-3\% throughout the project. 

	\vspace{0.5em}		

	\noindent
	Support for a {\bf postdoctoral research associate} is  \$47,500 and  is based on the current common University rate.
		\vspace{1.2em}			

		\subsection*{Fringe benefits} 
		\vspace{0.5em}			
	
		\noindent 	
		Fringe benefits are charged at the currently approved and anticipated rates of 33\%
		for PI, 19\% for a postdoc, 
		16\% for a graduate student.% and 8.65\% for hourly employees (temps and undergraduate students).
