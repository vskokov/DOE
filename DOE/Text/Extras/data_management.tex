We will follow the below protocol: 
\begin{itemize}

	\item 
The published data will be distributed as  supplementary  material for each 
published manuscript in a widely used format, e.~g. 
ASCII or tab-delimited  format. 
Instructional material will be provided in 
the manuscripts and in text form along  with the data. 
The data will be strictly in standard, non-proprietary file formats 
to facilitate  data sharing. 

\item 
For each published manuscript, in case of large data files, 
the PI will make copies of data 
available to co-investigators, students, and
others by request within 30 days of receipt of the request. 
 


	\item
The simulation code will be developed in C++, Python and Julia, 
the data processing  scripts will be written using sed and awk. 
Every piece of written software or script will 
be provided to the public in source code format for non-commercial use 
under GNU General Public License (GPL). 
For each code made available, a user's manual will be provided with
instructions for compiling the source codes, installing and running the codes,
formulating input data streams, and visualizing the output. Documentation will
be in PDF format.
Source codes will be published on the North Carolina State University 
	GitHub web page \url{https://github.ncsu.edu}. 

\item 
For all of the numerical simulations, representative input files will
be kept along with the sources codes. Sample  output files 
will also be provided when possible. 

\end{itemize}
