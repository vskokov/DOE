Below we discuss the essential background material and motivations for major
goals of the proposed research on this topic. 

\subsubsection*{Particle production in classical approximation}
	
To review the current theoretical  status of particle production in the saturation/CGC formalism,   
let us first consider the single inclusive gluon production cross section. 
Suppressing impact parameter dependence (see Ref.~\cite{Kovchegov:2018jun} for more details), 
the production cross section can be written as \cite{Kovchegov:1996ty,Kovchegov:1997pc} 
 \begin{align}
   \frac{dN}{d^2 k \, d^2 b \, d^2 B} 
   = \frac{1}{\alpha_s} \, f \left( 
   \frac{Q_{sp}^2}{k^2},  	 
   \frac{Q_{sA}^2}{k^2}  	 
   \right)\, ,
 \end{align}
 where $Q_{sp}$ and $Q_{sA}$ are the saturation momenta 
 for the projectile and target, $\alpha_s$ is the strong coupling constant,
 $B$ is the impact parameter between the projectile nuclei or nucleon and target nucleus, $b$ is the transverse
 position of the gluon. 
 %\cite{McLerran:1994vd,McLerran:1993ka,McLerran:1993ni,Kovchegov:1996ty,Kovchegov:1997pc}. 
 The function $f$ was only studied numerically~\cite{Krasnitz:1999wc,Krasnitz:2003jw,Lappi:2003bi,Blaizot:2010kh}. 
 Analytically tractable is only its expansion in either one of the arguments.
 In the {\it dilute-dense} approximation valid for asymmetric collisions, one assumes 
 that the projectile is a dilute object, $  \frac{Q_{sp}^2}{k^2} \lsim
 1$ which facilitates the expansion of the production cross section in this parameter
\begin{align}
  \frac{dN}{d^2 k \, d^2 b \, d^2 B} = \frac{1}{\as} \, \left[
     \frac{Q_{sp}^2}{k^2}
	  \ f_1 \! \left(  \frac{Q_{sA}^2}{k^2} \right) +
    \left(  \frac{Q_{sp}^2}{k^2} \right)^2 \ f_2 \! \left(  \frac{Q_{sA}^2}{k^2} \right) + \ldots \right].
  \label{Eq:SIP}
\end{align}
The function $f_1$ is known analytically 
\cite{Kovchegov:1998bi,Dumitru:2001ux}. 
At this order the number of produced gluons for  given projectile and target configurations is given by 
\begin{equation}
\left.\frac{dN}{d^{2}kdy}\right|_{\rho_{\rm p},\rho_{\rm t}}=\frac{2g^{2}}{(2\pi)^{3}}\int\frac{d^{2}q}{(2\pi)^{2}}\frac{d^{2}q'}{(2\pi)^{2}}\Gamma(\v{k},\v{q},\v{q}')\rho_{\rm p}^{a}(-\v{q}')\left[U^{\dagger}(\v{k}-\v{q}')U(\v{k}-\v{q})\right]_{ab}\rho_{\rm p}^{b}(\v{q}),
\label{eq:SIPc}
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma(\v{k},\v{q},\v{q}')$ is the square of Lipatov vertex, 
see \myref~\cite{Kovner:2018azs} for details. 
%\begin{equation}
%\Gamma(\v{k},\v{q},\v{q}')=\left(\frac{\v{q}}{q^{2}}-\frac{\v{k}}{k^{2}}\right)
%\cdot \left(\frac{\v{q}'}{q'^{2}}-\frac{\v{k}}{k^{2}}\right)\,.
%\end{equation}
Here $\rho_{\rm p}$ is a given configuration of the color charged density in the projectile,
and $U$ is the eikonal scattering matrix -- the adjoint Wilson line -- for scattering of
a single gluon on the target.
The target Wilson lines depend on the target color sources, $\rho_{\rm t}$. 


Functions $f_2 , f_3 , \ldots$ are
not known analytically at present.
Here we want to explain what we mean by  analytical results, 
as e.g. $f_i$ may still involve rather  complicated momentum integrals 
of  Wilson lines of the target field, see e.g. Eq.~\eqref{eq:SIPc}. 
Getting to a number, often requires using $f_i$ to 
conduct numerical lattice simulations. This is why in what follow we 
often refer to this as semi-analytical approach. 
In contrast to numerical Classical Yang-Mills (CYM)
calculations, $f_i$ require neither numerical solution 
for the proper time dependence nor numerical implementation of 
LSZ (projection of gluon field time evolution to asymptotic particle states). 
Also the advantage of this semi-analytic  
approach is that, in contrast to numerical CYM, the dilute-dense semi-analytic 
results facilitate inclusion of small $x$ evolution, 
running coupling corrections and, finally, they are superior 
in terms of simulation time and allow for easier access to 
the continuum limit. 
 

Returning back to  expansion~\eqref{Eq:SIP},  
the next contribution, 
the function $f_2$, is  also termed as the {\it first saturation correction} in the
projectile, since it comes in with two powers of $Q_{sp}^2/k^2$,
corresponding to interactions with two valence sources in the projectile. 
The efforts to calculate $f_2$ analytically was started in
\myref\cite{Balitsky:2004rr} and more recently revisited in
\myref\cite{Chirilli:2015tea}. Despite this effort,  $f_2$ is known only partially 
and its complete analytic calculation is one of the goals of this proposal. 
Phenomenologically $f_2$ is of paramount importance because it defines the first non-trivial 
correction to the strict dilute-dense approximation and thus provides a systematic
check on the applicability/convergence  of this approximation. 
$f_2$  also bridges the gap between dilute-dense and dense-dense 
approaches. 


%The calculation of the order-$\left(
%  Q_{sp}^2/k^2 \right)^2$ correction implies including an
%order-$\as^2$ correction to the projectile interaction as compared to
%the leading order-$Q_{sp}^2/k^2$ term from
%\myref\cite{Kovchegov:1998bi}. This order-$\as^2$ correction involves
%interaction with the extra valence source in the projectile, which brings in
%an additional $Q_s^2/\alpha_s^2$ factor. With the help of the retarded gluon
%Green function one can rearrange the diagrams such that the
%order-$\as^2$ correction enters in two different ways: it may enter as an
%order-$\as$ correction in the amplitude {\sl and} in the complex
%conjugate amplitude, or as an order-$\as^2$ correction either in the
%amplitude or in the complex conjugate amplitude. The former case was
%calculated in \myrefs\cite{Balitsky:2004rr,Chirilli:2015tea}, where the
%order-$\as$ correction to the leading-order (pA) gluon production
%amplitude was found. No one has yet analytically calculated the
%order-$\as^2$ correction to the same amplitude to complete the efforts
%to determine $f_2$!
 
 
The same discussion  applies to the two-gluon production. For the
classical two-gluon production cross section one can write
\begin{align}
	\frac{dN}{d^2 k_1 \, d^2 b_1 \, d^2 k_2 \, d^2 b_2 \, d^2 B} 
  = \frac{1}{\as^2} \, h
  \left( 
  \frac{Q_{sp}^2}{k^2},  	 
   \frac{Q_{sA}^2}{k^2}  	 
  \right)
 \end{align}
 with the new unknown function $h$. Here $k_1$ and $k_2$ are the
 gluons' transverse momenta (here to simplify notation 
 we assumed that $|k_1|=|k_2|=k$), while $b_i$ are their
 transverse positions. Again, assuming a dilute projectile we expand
 in $\frac{Q_{sp}^2}{k^2}$ getting
\begin{align}
  \frac{dN}{d^2 k_1 \, d^2 b_1 \, d^2 k_2 \, d^2 b_2 \, d^2 B} =
  \frac{1}{\as^2} \, \left[ \left( \frac{Q_{sp}^2}{k^2}  \right)^2 \ 
	  h_1
    \!\left(  \frac{Q_{sA}^2}{k^2} \right) + \left( \frac{Q_{sp}^2}{k^2}  \right)^3 \ h_2 \! \left( \frac{Q_{sA}^2}{k^2}  \right) + \ldots
  \right] .
  \label{Eq:DIP}
\end{align}
The function $h_1$ can be found from the results of
\myrefs\cite{Kovner:2012jm,Kovchegov:2012nd,Altinoluk:2018ogz}, 
explicitly it is also written in \myrefs\cite{Kovner:2018fxj}. 
Compared to $f_1$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:SIPc}, which has two target Wilson lines (dipole), 
the function $h_1$ involves four Wilson lines (quadrupole). 
This
part of the two-gluon production cross section is invariant  
under the reflection of either momenta $k_1$ or $k_2$ and thus 
generates  only even harmonics of azimuthal anisotropy. This is why finding the function $h_2$ 
was one of the highest priorities for saturation/CGC community. 
Recently, in Refs.~\cite{McLerran:2016snu,Kovchegov:2018jun},
it was shown that the accidental symmetry with respect to the 
reflection of one of the momenta is lifted by the 
first saturation contribution, $h_2$. 
The complete part of $h_2$ responsible for the
odd harmonics was derived analytically~\cite{McLerran:2016snu,Kovchegov:2018jun}. 
This progress allowed us to find the leading order contribution to odd harmonics and lead to 
a  
successful application of the framework to phenomenology of two particle correlations in p-A 
collisions~\cite{Mace:2018vwq,Mace:2018yvl}.
Nevertheless, the complete result for $h_2$ is currently unknown; 
deriving and numerically simulating it is one  of the goals of this project.
The complete results for the first saturation correction $h_2$
will enable us to quantify the reliability of the expansion~\eqref{Eq:DIP}
for extraction of even harmonics  $v_{2n}\{2\}$. 

We finally want to comment on the range of applicability  of the 
dilute-dense approximation in terms of hadrons participating in collisions. 
Besides the obvious application to p-A collisions, dilute-dense expansion 
can also be applied to A-A  and high-multiplicity p-p collisions. 
The latter, as also supported by experimental data on 
the event-by-event dependence of the number of particles on rapidity,   
is dominated by collisions in which one of the proton wave functions experienced 
a fluctuation with higher than average gluon density, or saturation momentum $Q_s$. 
The former, if considered locally, can often be described by the 
dilute-dense approach at least for some range of transverse momenta. 
In A-A collisions, the required hierarchy of saturation momenta originates from 
the fact that in a given event, for a given impact parameter in the transverse plane, it is quite unlikely
to have the same number of participants on the target and projectile side simultaneously. 
Since the target (projectile) saturation momentum squared is proportional to the number 
of participants in the target (projectile), the desired hierarchy can be achieved.   


%In this contexts, it is amusing Thus a nonzero value for odd azimuthal anisotropies in the CGC EFT can be understood to be a unique signature of the emerging coherence of the classical gluon field in the pro- jectile.


\subsubsection*{High multiplicity events and reweighting}
In recent years, the study of multiparticle correlations in 
p-A and p-p collisions have been a very active 
area of both experimental and theoretical research 
due to the observation of the long-range in rapidity 
azimuthal correlations (the so-called ridge)
at the LHC and RHIC.   
Since the observed ridge correlation is much more pronounced in high multiplicity
events, the understanding of the origin of high multiplicity
fluctuations and especially of the high multiplicity tail of the distribution describing 
particle production  
receives a lot of attention. 

Recently, at small $x$, this problem has been attacked from different angles, 
but lead to the universal result on the approximate negative binomial 
distribution for the high multiplicity tail, see e.g. Ref.~\cite{Liou:2016mfr,Kovner:2018azs}.  
In particular, PI with collaborators, derived an effective action describing 
the covariant gauge gluon field ($A^+$)  distribution in a hadron both in the McLerran-Venugopalan 
model~\cite{McLerran:1993ni,McLerran:1993ka} and in a (non-local) Gaussian 
approximation~\cite{Iancu:2002tr} 
for the small-x density matrix of 
the valence charge distribution. It was shown that the corresponding effective action is a Liouville action (without kinetic term and with negative Ricci scalar):
\begin{equation}
	\label{Eq:Veff}
	V_{\rm eff} [\eta(\v{q})] = \frac{1}{2} (N_c^2-1) S_\perp \int \frac{d^2q}{(2\pi)^2} 
	\left\{ \eta(\v{q}) -1 - \ln \eta (\v{q}) \right\}\,, \quad  \eta(\v{q})   =
	\frac{
		 {\rm tr} |A^+(\v{q})|^2} 
		{  \langle  {\rm tr} |A^+(\v{q})|^2 \rangle    }\,. 
\end{equation}
PI also demonstrated that small $x$  evolution preserves the shape of the effective 
potential and affects only its widths~\cite{Dumitru:2017cwt}, see Fig.~\ref{fig:veff}.

  to the potential derived analytically, see Eq.~\eqref{Eq:Veff}. Here  $Y=\log x_0/x$. 
	}

}
{ \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./figures/veff.pdf}
 }
\end{figure} 



Later, this effective theory was directly connected to 
the distribution of produced gluons in Ref.~\cite{Kovner:2018azs}. 
It turned out that the leading effect driving  the multiplicity 
fluctuations at small $x$ is the quantum Bose enhancement of gluons in the
proton wave function. Strikingly, from completely different presumptions,
the Liouville action was derived for the fluctuations of the effective saturation 
momentum~\cite{Iancu:2004es,Marquet:2006xm,Iancu:2007st}. 
In Refs.~\cite{Dumitru:2017cwt,Dumitru:2017ftq,Dumitru:2018iko} 
it was also realized that high multiplicity events at small $x$ 
cannot be parametrized by just a single  quantity  $Q_s$, 
but rather by a nontrivial function which depends on the transverse 
momentum and $x$. 

The systematic treatment of high multiplicity 
color charge configurations has only just begun and  
although this progress lead to a better understanding of the high multiplicity fluctuations, 
the state of the art numerical simulations in the saturation/CGC formalism 
(\cite{Mantysaari:2017cni,Mace:2018vwq,Mace:2018yvl} to name a few)
still rely 
on a brute force numerical approach to access the high multiplicity tail. 
In this approach, configurations of target and projectile are generated 
without any bias, the particle production and correlations are computed and a posteriori 
multiplicity selection is applied. 
Given the numerical complexity of sampling these configurations  on a 2+1 dimensional lattice
(two transverse directions and rapidity),  
this approach  is very inefficient in probing the 
high multiplicity tail, as most of the generated configurations are close to the most probable 
one. 

One of the goals of this proposal is to develop a theoretical high multiplicity ``trigger'', 
i.e. the reweighting technique providing  efficient access to the high multiplicity tail.   

\subsubsection*{Small-x evolution}
Apart from the general advantage of having a semi-analytic solution, 
the dilute-dense expansion or knowing the function $f_i$ and $h_i$ (see Eqs.~\eqref{Eq:SIP} and~\eqref{Eq:DIP}) 
can facilitate the inclusion of small-$x$ evolution corrections~\cite{Kuraev:1977fs,
Balitsky:1978ic, 
Balitsky:1997mk, 
Balitsky:1998ya, 
Kovchegov:1999yj,
Kovchegov:1999ua, 
JalilianMarian:1997dw, 
JalilianMarian:1997gr,
Iancu:2001ad, 
Iancu:2000hn}.
Presently, in this framework  the small-$x$ evolution has not been accounted for 
with a rare exception of single inclusive gluon production, see e.g. in Ref.~\cite{Dumitru:2018iko}. 
Usually, the dependence on $x$ is approximated by the IP-SAT model~\cite{Kowalski:2003hm,Rezaeian:2012ji},
which solves the leading order  DGLAP (Dokshitzer--Gribov--Lipatov--Altarelli--Parisi)  gluon evolution (neglecting its coupling to quarks) 
with analytically parametrized $x$ dependence at an initial 
transverse scale $\mu_0$. 
This approach provides a flexible and numerically simple method 
to the phenomenology. Nonetheless, incorporating actual non-linear 
small $x$ evolution is essential to study physics 
of high partonic densities and to extract phenomenological results from first principles.  
Doing so in the framework of JIMWLK (Jalilian-Marian--Iancu--McLerran--Weigert--Leonidov--Kovner) equation 
~\cite{JalilianMarian:1997dw, 
JalilianMarian:1997gr,
Iancu:2001ad, 
Iancu:2000hn} 
is one of the goals of this project. 
The JIMWLK equation is a functional integro-differential 
equation describing evolution of the distribution of Wilson lines (or, alternatively, color sources) in a 
hadron. At the leading order, JIWMLK equations can be rewritten in the Fokker-Planck form~\cite{Weigert:2000gi}
and thus it can be also reformulated as  a Langevin equation describing a generalized Brownian motion of 
the Wilson line. Owing to its complexity, no analytic solution of the JIMWLK equation exists. 
Its solution has been obtained only numerically, using lattice gauge theory methods for the
 Langevin form of JIMWLK equation.

 At next-to-leading order (NLO), the JIMWLK equation does not allow for a straightforward reformulation in the Langevin form~\cite{Kovner:2014lca,Balitsky:2013fea}. 
 This is why the NLO JIMWLK equation has not been solved numerically yet. 	




Physically small $x$ evolution accounts for soft gluon emission and thus 
also contributes to multiplicity fluctuations. It is an open question how to 
incorporate high multiplicity ``trigger'' in small $x$ evolution (that is how to perform 
reweighting at each step of small $x$ evolution).

\subsubsection*{Gluon saturation at an Electron-Ion Collider} 
Because the final state effects are  minimal in e-A collisions, 
the small $x$ saturation/CGC framework can with greater effect be applied to 
quantifying particle scattering and production at an Electron-Ion Collider. 
At small $x$, Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) can be described in the so-called color 
dipole approach~\cite{Gunion:1976iy,Nussinov:1975mw,Nussinov:1975qb,Marquet:2009ca}: 
the virtual photon emitted by the incoming electron splits into quark and anti-quark.
This pair scatters off the target. The scattering is treated in the eikonal approximation.
These approach can be used for a wide variety of inclusive and semi-inclusive processes  
along with  smoking gun signatures of gluon saturation: suppression of dihadron 
correlations 
 and diffraction, in particular diffractive meson production 
(see most recent study in Ref.~\cite{Mantysaari:2017slo}
and Ref.~\cite{Aschenauer:2017jsk} 
for a comprehensive review). 



One of the processes which received our attention  is dijet (a jet pair) production in DIS.
And although in the saturation/CGC formalism the color dipole approach is the most natural, 
it is important to mention, that in the correlations limit~\footnote{The correlation limit is  
the limit of almost back-to-back jets~\cite{Dominguez:2011wm,Dominguez:2011br}.}
it was shown that the saturation/CGC framework yields the same result for the dijet production
cross section as the one obtained within the Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) factorization 
framework~\cite{Mulders:2000sh,Bomhof:2006dp,Meissner:2007rx} at small $x$~\cite{Metz:2011wb,Dominguez:2011wm}. 



Both approaches universally demonstrated that  dijet production depends on   
the Weiz\-s\"acker-Williams (WW) transverse-momentum-dependent  gluon distribution.  
The TMD parton distributions signify the recent progress achieved in developing 
frameworks to extend our understanding of hadron structure  beyond the one-dimensional
parton distribution function (PDF), as the TMDs depend not only on the longitudinal momentum 
fraction $x$, but also on the transverse momentum and therefore contain more 
detailed information on the internal structure of hadrons relative to PDFs.
Quark TMDs are the most studied, while the available studies of gluon TMDs 
are rather sparse. In particular, the WW gluon distribution still awaits its experimental 
determination; also theoretically little had been known about the evolution of the distribution at small $x$ 
before Ref.~\cite{Dumitru:2015gaa} where PI and coauthors conducted the first small $x$ computation of 
both components for the WW gluon distribution: unpolarized and polarized one, see Fig~\ref{fig:xGxh}. 
Both components can be accessed through measuring azimuthal anisotropies in processes 
such as dijet production in e+p and e+A scattering. The linearly polarized
gluon distribution causes  a nontrivial azimuthal angular $\cos 2\phi$ dependence of the dijet cross section, 
as we illustrate by the leading order in $\alpha_s$  cross-section for inclusive
production of a $q+\bar q$ dijet in high energy deep inelastic
scattering of a longitudinally~\footnote{The cross section for the transversely polarized virtual photon can be found in Refs.~\cite{Metz:2011wb,Dominguez:2011wm}.} polarized virtual photon $\gamma^*$ off a proton or nucleus is
given by~\cite{Metz:2011wb,Dominguez:2011wm}
\begin{eqnarray}
E_1E_2
\frac{d\sigma ^{\gamma _{L}^{\ast }A\rightarrow q\bar{q}X}}{d^3k_1d^3k_2 d^2b}
&=&\alpha _{em}e_{q}^{2}\alpha _{s}\delta \left( 1-z-\bar z\right) z^2\bar z^2\frac{8\epsilon _{f}^{2}{P}_{\perp }^{2}}{(
{P}_{\perp }^{2}+\epsilon _{f}^{2})^{4}}  %\notag \\

  \phi\right)xh_{\perp }^{(1)}(x,q_{\perp })\right]\, .
\label{eq:dijet_L}
\end{eqnarray}
Here $\phi$ is the angle between the total momentum  ($P_\perp$) of dijet and the momentum imbalance  ($q_\perp$).
The feasibility of extracting the azimuthal anisotropy was 
consider in the proof of principle analysis of  Ref.~\cite{Dumitru:2018kuw}, where by doing Monte-Carlo simulations 
we showed that with some experimental effort the WW gluon distributions can
be successfully extracted, see Fig.~\ref{fig:extract}.

Here $\v{u}=\v{x_1}-\v{x_2}$ and $\v{u}^\prime=\v{x_1}^\prime-\v{x_2}^\prime$ and the angular brackets  represent averages over the 
target configurations. 
As we can see in Eq.~\eqref{Eq:disL},  the production cross section cannot be expressed in terms of  
	gluon TMDs but rather involve two- and four-point fundamental Wilson line ($U$) correlators  in coordinate space. 
	Using the general saturation/CGC framework results,  we 
	estimated the amplitude of the azimuthal $\langle \cos 4\phi  \rangle$
	dependence in Ref.~\cite{Dumitru:2016jku}; it involved a new gluon TMD, i.e. it was not reducible to known gluon distribution. 
	Besides higher order harmonics, corrections to the correlation limit also 
	modify the angular independent amplitude and the amplitude of $\langle \cos 2\phi  \rangle$ anisotropy.
	This means that the corrections may also propagate to the observable azimuthal anisotropy.  
	They are controlled by the ratio $q_\perp^2/P_\perp^2$~\cite{Dumitru:2016jku}.    
	At an EIC, given statistical and collision energy limitations,  the kinematic range for the momentum imbalance and the 
	total dijet momentum is rather narrow; at best we could hope to get the ratio of $1/4$.
	This means that higher order corrections at an EIC can be phenomenologically important. 
	This necessitates numerical estimates of these corrections and implementation of the 
	full saturation/CGC formalism result, i.e. including the   full quadrupole contribution.   
	This is one of the aims of this proposal.

We note that similar structures involving dipole and quadrupole 
terms appear in single and double inclusive production in the leading order of dilute-dense expansion in 
p-A and high multiplicity p-p collisions, see Eq.~\eqref{eq:SIPc} and the discussion on $h_1$ after 
Eq.~\eqref{Eq:DIP}. This illustrates an importance of a common framework to
particle production and scattering in 
p-p/A and e-A. 


Besides 
 extending and improving the dijet analysis, the application of the 
 developed framework to the smoking gun signatures of saturation in e-A collisions such as diffractive scattering/production
and dihadron correlations~\cite{Aschenauer:2017jsk} is also one of the goals of this project.

    \subsection{Detailed goals and methods}
        \label{sec:p11}

		Our main goal is to provide a unified systematic first-principle based description of
		initial-state effects and particle production/scattering in p-A, 
		high-multiplicity p-p, e-A and ultra peripheral p/A-A collisions.  
		The ultimate goal is to write and publish an open source  simulation code based on the same saturation/CGC framework and 
		the same set of parameters across different colliding systems. 

		The main milestones to be reached are listed below:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Derivation of the first saturation correction to the leading order 
				dilute-dense approximation for single and double 
				inclusive gluon production, i.e. $f_2$ of Eq.~\eqref{Eq:SIP} and $h_2$  of Eq.~\eqref{Eq:DIP} correspondingly. 
				Previously, the PI with collaborators
				derived the momentum odd contribution to the double inclusive production, $h_2$, see Eq.~\eqref{Eq:DIP}, 
				in two different gauges: first in  the Fock-Schwinger gauge (this gauge is formulated in the coordinate space), see Ref.~\cite{McLerran:2016snu} and 
				then in the global light-cone gauge, see Ref.~\cite{Kovchegov:2018jun}.


				It may be straightforward, although technically difficult to derive complete 
				results for  $f_2$ and $h_2$ in the light-cone gauge. Thus, instead, 
				our approach will be based on the Fock-Schwinger gauge, where higher order corrections 
				can be obtained by iteratively solving classical Yang-Mills equation~\cite{Dumitru:2001ux,McLerran:2016snu}
				with appropriate boundary conditions~\cite{Kovner:1995ts}.
				The form of the result in the Fock-Schwinger gauge is usually the most convenient for 
				further numerical analysis on the lattice~\cite{Kovchegov:2018jun}.
				If we confront with unforeseen difficulties in the Fock-Schwinger gauge,
				we will be able to perform analytics in the light-cone gauge.  


				As was repeatedly pointed out  in Refs.~\cite{Mace:2018vwq,Mace:2018yvl}, the knowledge of the first saturation corrections, 
				$f_2$ and $h_2$, is required to estimate systematic uncertainties of the dilute-dense 
				approximation and, potentially, extend the range of applicability of the dilute-dense expansion to higher 
				gluon densities in the projectile. Also, higher order corrections may potentially reveal new non-trivial multi-gluon
				effects in two particle correlation patterns.  
			
				We will also  explore if higher order corrections, $f_2$ and $h_2$ can be written in approximately 
				$k_\perp$-factorized form as was previously done for the leading order dilute-dense expansion 
				of the double inclusive production~\cite{Kovchegov:2013ewa}.

			\item Developing reweighting  for high multiplicity.  A posteriori multiplicity 
				selection is not well suited to probe extremely high multiplicity events. This necessitates 
				establishing an appropriate a priori reweighting
				techniques. Based on the insights we gained by computing gluon multiplicity distribution
				in a dilute  projectile~\cite{Dumitru:2017cwt,Dumitru:2017ftq,Dumitru:2018iko}, our  goal 
				is to  develop a reweighting which would  allow us to access the
				high-multiplicity tail; we will use this technique to compute multiparticle correlations
				and nuclear modification factor.  

			\item Accounting for small $x$ evolution for particle production and correlations. 
				Application of the framework in the wide range of energies from RHIC and an EIC to the LHC  requires 
				inclusion of small $x$ evolution. The dilute-dense approximation allows straightforward 
				numerical implementation  of the evolution, which we will account for using the leading order 
				JIMWLK equation. 

				Along with this we will consider two high risk problems detailed below. 
				We want to stress that success of this project does not rely on solving them. %se problems. 
				\begin{itemize}
					\item[--]
				We  plan to explore the possibility of reformulating the NLO JIMWLK in the Langevin form and 
				solving it numerically. It is possible that the reweighting method developed in the course of this  project 
				will facilitate projection of each evolution step of the leading order JIMWLK to NLO. These ideas are only 
				in its inception and will be considered in details during the implementation of this stage of the project.
					\item[--]
				From the result of Refs.~\cite{McLerran:2016snu,Kovchegov:2018jun}, it appears that 
				the presence of transverse momentum odd correlations in double inclusive production cross section 
				requires some degree of final state interactions (although 
				this statement may be gauge-dependent). It is thus important to understand if there
				are transverse momentum odd correlations in the {\it incoming} hadron wave function at small $x$
				before scattering and particle production. PI and collaborators  explored  this in an adhoc  JIMWLK-motivated 
				wave function in Ref.~\cite{Kovner:2016jfp}; to improve  these calculations  we will consider 
				the hadron wave function derived from JIMWLK under controlled approximations.  
				\end{itemize}
			
			\item 
				Implementing the following key improvements to the Monte-Carlo dijet event generator (MCDijet) 
				for an EIC~\cite{Dumitru:2018kuw}:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item[--] incorporating event-by-event nucleon position fluctuations in nuclear target; 
					\item[--] studying correlations between dijet production and gluon multiplicity fluctuations 
						in the nuclear target; this might provide a realistic experimental probe 
						of WW gluon distribution in rare configurations of the nucleus/proton;
					\item[--] incorporating corrections to the correlation limit and simulations with complete 
						quad\-rupole contribution to dijet production; 
					\item[--] taking into account Sudakov corrections (similar to analysis of Ref.~\cite{Zheng:2014vka});  
					\item[--] probing model dependence with different color sources distributions 
						besides commonly used McLerran-Venugopalan (MV) model~\cite{McLerran:1993ni}. 
						Usually the initial conditions for JIM\-WLK evolution are taken following 
						the MV model which is rigorously formulated only for large nuclei at 
						small $x$. For a proton at moderate and large $x$, the color charge 
						distribution can be quite different from the MV model. 
						As was shown in a recent paper~\cite{Dumitru:2018vpr}, a
						standard light front Hamiltonian framework~\cite{Brodsky:1997de} can be used to compute color charge 
						distribution in nucleons and nuclei~\footnote{On the subject of light front quark model, 
							we will tap into the expertise of a local nuclear theorist: Chueng-Ryong Ji.}  		
							; we want to implement this color distribution 
						to test model dependence of the results and provide better estimates on 
						dijet production at an EIC in a wide range of the targets' atomic number.    
				\end{itemize}
				These improvements are required in order to provide a realistic description of DIS
				dijet production at an EIC. 

				Additionally, we plan to extend MCDijet to ultra peripheral collision  (UPC) at hadron 
				colliders, such as RHIC and, especially, the LHC. 
				At very large impact-parameters between colliding hadrons the long range electromagnetic
				force becomes dominant over short-range QCD allowing for the dipole approach to 
				dijet production in UPC. One significant difference compared to DIS is that, for
				the UPC kinematics, the photon virtuality  is negligible; 
				this leads to a vanishing amplitude in front of the linearly polarized gluon 
				distribution $x h^{(1)}_\perp$ (see e.g.~\cite{Dominguez:2011br}), 
				but the unpolarized gluon distribution, $xG^{(1)}$,  can be extracted. 
				We plan to conduct the realistic feasibility study of extracting  $xG^{(1)}$ in UPC 
				by 
				a) replacing the electron's photon fluxes with that from a proton or nucleus, as detailed in 
				Ref.~\cite{Klein:1999gv}
				and b) extending the range of accessible $x$ towards smaller values probed by  the LHC. 

				We also plan to modify MCDijet event generator to simulate the 
				suppression of dihadron correlations and diffractive meson production (beyond IP-SAT-based approach of Ref.~\cite{Toll:2012mb}). 	

			\item Application to phenomenology of p-p, p-A and e-A collisions. 
				In particular, we are interested in extracting the following observables 
				\begin{itemize}
					\item[--] Three-gluon correlations to explore if 
						the framework's systematics is similar to the STAR measurements
						in peripheral A-A collisions~\cite{Adamczyk:2017hdl,Adamczyk:2017byf};  	
					\item[--] Four particle correlations and integrated and differential $v_n\{4\}$ as a function of  multiplicity and collision energy; 
					\item[--] Nuclear modification factor with multiplicity bias, so-called $Q_{pA}$~\cite{Adam:2014qja};   
					\item[--] 
					Systematics of Dijet Production at an EIC and UPC: 
					dependence on the atomic number, energy dependence, 
					prediction for high order harmonics of azimuthal anisotropy, 
					feasibility check of extracting correlation between dijet production and forward nucleus going  multiplicity, as a probe of biased WW gluon distribution, crystallizing the role of gluon saturation in dijet observables.  
				\end{itemize}

\section{Proposed Research: Entanglement and full density matrix}
    \label{sec:p2}

    \vspace{0.5em}
    \subsection{Background}
    \label{sec:p2b}

	A key property distinguishing 
	quantum systems from classical ones is the entanglement 
	of otherwise distinct degrees of freedom. 
	Due to entanglement of certain degrees of freedom (e.g. soft/semi-hard gluons) 
	with the rest of a quantum system (e.g. valence color charges), their description
	is not possible by a pure state. 
	Rather, the most complete description of a subsystem 
 	is via the reduced density matrix
	obtained 
	by tracing over the degrees of freedom in the complement. 
	Recently, these ideas 
	were considered in the context of small $x$ physics 
	both in momentum~\cite{Kovner:2015hga} (see Ref.~\cite{Liu:2018gae} 
	for an approach using the AdS/CFT correspondence) and coordinate spaces~\cite{Kharzeev:2017qzs,Hagiwara:2017uaz}. 
	It was suggested that, in hadronic collisions,  the 
	apparent thermal nature of the produced soft 
	particle spectra
	might originate  from entanglement between the different 
	degrees of freedom in the hadronic wave function; 
	that is the complement hadronic degrees of freedom 
	are entangled by those measured in experiments 
	and thus serve as an effective thermal bath. 


	The calculations of the momentum entanglement 
	between the valence color charges and soft gluons field 
 	of Ref.~\cite{Kovner:2015hga} were performed only in the framework of the 
	MV model and require an extension to account for small $x$ evolution. 

	All calculations in high-energy hadronic collisions 
	were performed assuming that the density matrix  in the basis 
	of valence charge density is diagonal. This assumption 
	is manifest in the MV model. Computing off diagonal 
	components might be a missing link to understanding 
	hadronic wave function. 


    \vspace{0.5em}
    \subsection{Detailed goals and methods}
        \label{sec:p21}
	The main idea in computing the off-diagonal component of the density matrix 
	in the basis  of valence charge density is that there should be a nontrivial 
	correlation between the profile of the charge density 
	and the current density in the hadronic wave function at high energy. 
	By repeating the JIMWLK derivation, we plan to extract evolution
	for the full density matrix including the off-diagonal components. We plan to investigate 
	the evolution numerically and to analytically study % investigate 
	high-energy fixed point in the non-local Gaussian approximation.  

	The full density matrix can be generalized by considering the 
	valence charge densities at different rapidities, 
	thus giving access to the evolution of the entanglement entropy.

\section{Proposed Research: Quantum statistics at small $x$}
    \label{sec:p3}

    \vspace{0.5em}
    \subsection{Background and motivation}
    \label{sec:p3b}
	Although the quantum statistic effects are exuberant at small $x$, 
	only recently their significance was recognized in observables. 
	In particular, 
	for gluons, three sources of multiparticle  correlations were rigorously established at 
	small $x$: -- Bose enhancement, -- Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT), and classical effects due to 
	scattering off a domain with spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking of the direction of 
	color field~\cite{Dumitru:2014yza,Dumitru:2014vka,Dumitru:2015cfa}. It was shown that two genuinely quantum effects dominate over the classical one 
	almost in the entire phenomenologically relevant kinematic range~\cite{Kovner:2018azs}.
	Specifically, it was demonstrated that the ridge correlations at small $x$ are 
	due mostly to gluon Bose enhancement and 
	HBT~\cite{Kovchegov:2013ewa,Kovchegov:2012nd,Altinoluk:2015uaa,Altinoluk:2018ogz,Kovner:2018fxj,Kovchegov:2018jun};
	also  it was recently identified 
	that gluon Bose enhancement is responsible for the high multiplicity tail in p-A collisions~\cite{Kovner:2018azs}. 
	Finally, it was shown that Fermi statistics may lead to non-trivial effects at small $x$~\cite{Altinoluk:2016vax,Kovner:2017ssr,Kovner:2018vec} 
and potentially be responsible for a significant background contribution to the Chiral Magnetic Effect~\cite{Kovner:2017gab}. 
	The latter was established only on the level of particle correlations in the incoming projectile wave function; 
	quite recently the saturation/CGC framework was applied to derive semi-analytic equations describing 
	three particle correlations, including the CME observable~\cite{Martinez:2018tuf}. Numerical calculations of these 
	correlations have not yet been performed and currently we can only speculate how large 
	this contribution is in p-A and A-A collisions. One of the goals of this project is to 
	numerically extract CME correlator in dilute-dense saturation/CGC framework and to asses its phenomenological importance 
	for CME studies. 

	Quantum statistics might be responsible not only for the intriguing observation of three particle CME-like correlations 
	in p-A collisions, but also for an observed near-side baryon--baryon anti-correlation structure in p-p 
	collisions~\cite{Adam:2016iwf} at the LHC. Currently, the description of this effect presents a challenge 
	to all Monte-Carlo models, and its origin is an open question. Exploratory studies to test if these anti-correlations are 
    related to parton statistics at small $x$ will be conducted in the project.  


	


    \vspace{0.5em}
    \subsection{Detailed goals and methods}
        \label{sec:p31}

		Here, the main goal is to elucidate the role of quantum statistics effects at small $x$ by 
		conducting analytical and numerical analysis of quark and gluon production and correlations. 
		The main milestones are 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item By conducting 
				numerical simulation of deuteron-A collision 
				on the lattice, test the hypothesis that high multiplicity tail is dominated by 
				configurations of the deuteron with the overlapping nucleons in the transverse direction~\cite{Kovner:2018azs,Mace:2018vwq}. 
				The foundation of this hypothesis is based on gluon Bose enhancement in the projectile~\cite{Mace:2018vwq}.   
			\item To implement  a realistic wave function for the {\it polarized} deuteron. 
				Due to an admixture of the 
				$D$-wave state in the deuteron wave function (see e.g. \myref\cite{Machleidt:2000ge}), 
				the direction of deuteron polarization defines the spatial
				anisotropy of deuteron. Thus polarized deutron-nucleus collisions 
				at high energy provide unique testing ground  for measuring effects of quantum statistics that are  sensitive to the 
				deuteron wave function -- including Bose enhancement and HBT. Additionally  the polarized deuteron collisions 
				provide the knowledge of the initial eccentricity and a good handle on the reaction plane orientation; 
				this may facilitate disentangling and testing the role of initial and final state effects in driving
				azimuthal anisotropy in d-A collisions.
			\item  To test  numerically the saturation/CGC predictions in polarized d-A collisions, in particular: -- that  the longitudinal 
				deuteron polarization leads to greater multiplicity fluctuations than the transverse deuteron polarization,  --  that 
				two gluon correlations are stronger along the axis polarization due to gluon HBT. Assessing if this effect can be experimentally
				measured.
			\item To implement  quark production in the framework. Applying the framework to extract numerically: -- 
				the background contribution to the Chiral Magnetic Effect, i.e. the three particle charge-dependent correlator, -- 
				the quark--quark and quark--anti-quark correlation function and explore if it may be responsible for the 
				observed baryon-baryon rapidity anti-correlation. 
			\item To provide a realistic 
				initial baryon number  distribution in the coordinate space for further hydrodynamic evolution in A-A collisions. 
		\end{itemize}
		
		
		Utilizing  the results of the above research, complemented by that conducted previously, 
		we plan to write a comprehensive review on the quantum statistics effects at small $x$.
